        <div><div class="question"><h2>If you saw a Lanternfly Would you kill it?</h2></div><p>

          The Lanternfly Project started after a brief interaction I had with a lanternfly, where I was going to step on it, but just before my foot fell, I stopped. I became frozen. 
          
          I didn't realize at first but I was being confronted by something much larger than the invasive bug that sat below my foot. I'm not sure it has a simple name: The overwhelming weight of everything that has ever happened? 
          
          The arrival of the lanternfly to the New York Area was just one event in a chain of events that started long before you or I was born and will likely continue far after. Histories of global trade, chinoiserie gardens, colonialism, immigration, all combine into this small insect. 
          
          But everything is like this, if you think through and navigate these webs of connections, any decision you make no matter how small has the possibility of becoming completely overwhelming. Maybe it's best not to think about it.
          
          Step on the bug or don’t, what difference will it make. </p></div>
          
          
<div><h2>The project started out as a questionnaire designed to be impossible to answer.
</h2><p>it asked arbitrary questions or questions that were purposefully overwhelming. But despite the impossibility of the questions, you always still had a choice.

          <div><h2>A Series of Paradoxes</h2><p>Calatrava: Against Gravity is an identity for a fictional exhibition featuring the architectural drawings of Santiago Calatrava. 

            Calatrava’s architecture, while fundamentally inspired by the human form, is hard to imagine as grounded by any means. The buildings often appear as spaceships ready for flight, intricate detailing and ‘gravity’ defying; they often seem to push the limits of engineering and technology. 
            
            Calatrava's work is then built from a series of paradoxes, light and heavy, simple and complex, ancient and futuristic.  </p></div>

          <div><h2>Buildings and Cities</h2><p>inspired by calatrava's strcutres and the first iteration logo, the design seeks to capture the paradoxes that outline the work. made from a combination of the regular and italc "A" character of helvetcia neue, the design creates complexity from simplicity. The design at times apears like a ruinc scrpit or alien structures, emboding the acient and furutrisc dhicotmey. made from repeating A frames and stacked apon eachother, they are structral yet airy. </p></div>
