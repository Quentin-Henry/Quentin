        <div class="pb"><div class="question"><h2>If you saw a lanternfly would you kill it?</h2></div><p>

          The lanternfly project began as a response to a feeling of hesitation. The first summer the swarm of invasive insects decided on New York, I found myself in a position to kill one. I had heard that you should kill them since they damage the local ecosystem. But with my foot over the small creature, I found myself stuck. I didn't want to kill it. 

          I was sent into a spiral of questioning, would I kill it if it was ugly or if it was a biting insect? Am I really stepping on this bug because I was told to do so and I never once thought to do any research? I soon realized I was beginning to be confronted with something that doesn't have a simple name. 
          
           </p></div>
           <div><img src="lanternflyContent/lanternflyBackground2.gif"></div>
          <div class="pb"><h2>The overwhelming weight of everything that has ever happened. </h2><p>This insect sat at the metaphorical tip of the iceberg, and under the surface was a chain of events that started long before you or I was born and will likely continue after. Histories of global trade, westward expansion, colonialism, chinoiserie gardens, climate change, and the Cold War all accumulated into a single moment where a bug from southeast Asia sat under the shadow of my foot in New York City. 
            But anything can be like this if you think about it. Even the smallest decisions can come to contain the weight of everything that has happened and everything that has yet to happen. And in this moment it is easy to feel insignificant and powerless. Like an insect. Maybe it's something that is best to not think about. 
            Step on the bug, or don't. What difference will it make? 
          </p></div>
          
<div><h2>The project started out as a questionnaire designed to be impossible to answer.
</h2><p>It asked arbitrary questions and questions that were purposely overwhelming. But to continue you always have to make a decision. It seeks to make the participant ask more questions about themselves than the questionnaire ever asks the participant. 

  With each question answered more dots appear, increasing the number of possible answers. And mirroring the growing presence of the lanternfly.

        <div><p>In the winter when lanternflies no longer fill the air, the mascot was created as both a reminder of their lasting presence and also as a way to think about this web of connections. What would It mean for the lantern fly to become a symbol for New York? Although a relatively new co-inhabitant of the city, the insect has already made a lasting impression, it is invasive, stylish, clumsy, and hitchhiked all the way to New York. What does it mean to be invasive here?</p></div>

          <div class="pb"><h2>A Series of Paradoxes </h2><p>Calatrava: Against Gravity is an identity design project for a fictional exhibition featuring the architectural drawings of the architect Santiago Calatrava. While Calatrava's architecture is fundamentally inspired by the human body, it is hard to imagine it being grounded by any means. His structures often appear as spaceships ready for flight. With Intricate detailing and massive asymmetrical forms, the structures often appear gravity-defying, pushing the limits of engineering and technology. Sometimes even at the price of structural stability. 
            Calatrava's work is then built by a series of paradoxes. Structures that are both simple and complex, light and heavy, balanced and imbalanced, ancient and futuristic, modest and arrogant.
