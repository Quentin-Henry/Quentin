        <div><p>If you saw a Lanternfly Would you kill it?

          The Lanternfly Project started after a brief interaction I had with a lanternfly, where I was going to step on it, but just before my foot fell, I stopped. I became frozen. 
          
          I didn't realize at first but I was being confronted by something much larger than the invasive bug that sat below my foot. I'm not sure it has a simple name: The overwhelming weight of everything that has ever happened? 
          
          The arrival of the lanternfly to the New York Area was just one event in a chain of events that started long before you or I was born and will likely continue far after. Histories of global trade, chinoiserie gardens, colonialism, immigration, all combine into this small insect. 
          
          But everything is like this, if you think through and navigate these webs of connections, any decision you make no matter how small has the possibility of becoming completely overwhelming. Maybe it's best not to think about it.
          
          Step on the bug or don’t, what difference will it make. </p></div>

            Although a relatively new co-inhabitant of the city, the insect has already made a lasting impression, its invasive, stylish, clumsy, and hitchhiked all the way to New York.

          <div><p>Santiago Calatrava: Against Gravity is an identity for a fictional exhibition featuring the architectural drawings of Santiago Calatrava. 

            Calatrava’s architecture, while fundamentally inspired by the human form, is hard to imagine as grounded by any means. The buildings often appear as spaceships ready for flight, intricate detailing and ‘gravity’ defying; they often seem to push the limits of engineering and technology. 
            
            Calatrava's work is then built from a series of paradoxes, light and heavy, simple and complex, ancient and futuristic.  </p></div>

            The waves, coded with paper.js symbolize the interaction of three people, emotional wavelengths and communication, as well as a sense of relaxation, like waves onto a beach or the floating amorphous forms of a lava lamp. 
            
            The amplitude of the sine waves are individually affected to varying degrees by the mouse's position. At times they follow each other, and others they diverge. Each time the website is viewed the user creates the conditions for a unique visual experience.     
            
            With inspirations like Anni Albers we sought to create a website that was both inviting and warm, homemade, but also professional.

I was going to school at the Cooper union a few blocks from where I was born and began to feel increasingly claustrophobic, like I was only traveling in circles. I packed my bags and for 6 months traveled east, circled the globe, and ended up traveling in one big circle right back to New York.  

        When i got back i set out to make a project about this experience, this project is still ongoing
