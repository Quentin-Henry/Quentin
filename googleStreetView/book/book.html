    <p>The taxi to the airport 
        each second has been drawn out. Leaving felt like dying. The day before the flight all I had thought of was death, terminal illnesses, what it must feel like to know your time is limited. Of course all of our times are always limited, but this moment in the taxi, the limit is familiar. I don’t know how long decades are, I haven’t experienced enough of them, but I’ve been through plenty of hours, and 30 minute segments of time to know how unpredictable they can be. I know how they can drag on and never end, and how they can fly by without notice. And I know how time is somewhat shy and likes to stand still when you stare at it, like a child mistakes stillness for invisibility. But my fear is ultimately an inability to deal with inevitability, and unfortunately I cannot pause time no matter how intently I watch it. This taxi ride will end, and I hope it does, yet the part of me that wishes to be the driver of this car just to gently press the breaks enough to be late, would keep the car in the center of the highway stalled out until a distracted driver hit us from behind.     
        We drove up onto the BQE, out the window I stared out at all those cemeteries they put on the former outskirts of the city. I wonder where they put all the people today. Do you just get cremated in New York? Getting a whole spot for a grave, that’s like getting the coveted, generationally-passed-down parking spot in midtown or at some metro north station in connecticut. Maybe one day they could build a graveyard skyscraper. The whole thing floor after floor would just be for graves, and memorials. The elevators would be very slow and play somber classical music. Each floor would have a theme for how the deceased wanted to spend eternity in, maybe some could look just like the offices they never left in their former life, for others the walls could be painted sky blue and fans would blow soft air, sand and a bit of sea mist, the guests might even leave leave pleasantly exfoliated and tanned. as you went up this tower, the graves would become increasingly expensive due to their proximity to heaven. I want to tell the driver about this idea. Not because I think it’s particularly useful to him, I have this feeling he wouldn’t understand, but who’s to say, Maybe he’ll turn around and say, 
        <pre>           “I’ve always thought about that. 
            A graveyard skyscraper would be a great idea because we could build it right in the heart of Manhattan, I could visit my 
            parents on my lunch break, no more are the days where you have to drive prohibitively long distances just to leave a flower 
            at the base of some stone. I mean It's the 21st century.”</pre>
          Ultimately I just want to see how he’d react. But He’s busy listening to an audiobook and hasn't spoken a word to me since I told him Lagaurdia. I assume he'll ask what airline soon but I'm waiting for the chance that he won't. I haven’t really been paying attention but the more I listened to this book the stranger it was, the reader had a British accent. and I’m guessing I started listening somewhere in the middle of this story, maybe tossed into it violently. A man was fighting a tiger, somewhere deep in the jungle. They were both flickering in the torchlight, it was just past sunset before the sky became fully dark, the man was slightly crouched preparing to dodge the tigers oncoming lunge. The people of the village are all watching, it’s in a pit, its hard to tell if this is punishment or just amusement. If the man beats the tiger he walks free. But it does beg the question: how does a man beat a tiger? A gun maybe, but this man is close to naked, in a fair fight the tiger would always win, the only thing this man possesses as a potential advantage over this tiger is strategic thinking. The tiger lunges, the man dodges, but not enough, the claw pierces flesh, it drew a few lines down the arm and a few seconds later deep red liquid ran out. The tiger tries to strike again and misses in the comotion, the man backs up staggering this time legs shaking, arm running blood, he looks up at the tiger again eye meets eye. But for me the story ends there.

        The car arrives and I get out, I only have one bag. All the fear I had held began to wash away, walking through the revolving doors at LaGuardia. I’ve always wanted to have one of those dramatic airport moments where someone’s runs down the terminal hall at me, we can hug for the last time in a long time, and say something to hold on to, probably something heavy. Yet today you can't make it past security and those heavy words that weigh down on you, could potentially be mistaken for lead or other heavy metals and confiscated. They'd pull those words right back out of my brain through the right ear, they'd drop them on the table a little too hard and take test strips out and wipe them down a few times. they'd give them back soon enough but i'd have a hard time putting it back into my head and they might say something else because all the words got mixed around.    
        I went through the routine quickly and headed to my gate. I hadn't eaten all day because of my nerves and this would be the last chance for a while. I saw Dunkin 'Donuts on the far end of the hall and headed there. It's not my favorite but it works. I ordered a bagel and a muffin. I thought of coffee but decided not to, I was anxious enough as is.  
        This guy came up and stood next to me in the otherwise empty morning terminal. 
        <pre>               Morning,
                    Morning I smiled politely   
        Do you like dunkin?
    What kind of question is that?
            Yeah I think its nice
                Yeah I was actually looking for a Dunkin doughnuts also…
                I found that I appreciate standardization in times of stress. Although I find this habit a bit boring, but I don’t want to hate on myself or anything. As a traveler I need moments of familiarity and I get them through fast food chains.
                When I traveled to Italy in my early 20s I ate exclusively at McDonald’s. People tend to think this is some kind of sin, or ask why I even travel, but I’ll go anywhere really. Like this one time I went to Mumbai with my friend for a few days, we were headed to Australia and I thought why not do an interesting layover you know? 
            Yeah 
    I'm a bit too tired and emotionally drained for this, but I guess on the other hand it's a good distraction. Sometimes when people are this talkative it scares me just a little, like something might be a little loose up in the brain and it makes them unpredictable but, Everything about him looked average, average height, normal clothes not particularly nice but not bad either, it is an airport after all, I feel a bit bad for judging, he's probably nice, looks like he plays golf or something. Probably Went to a decent but not great university and got a pretty ok job and lives in some not-too-far suburb of a medium sized city in a medium sized state.    
                I'm a curious person after all. I mean that's human nature right? down where we were staying in Colaba, which is like the old town at the end of the peninsula in mumbai, there’s a Starbucks, I ate there every morning, then at night we went to Burger King, I wanted a burger so bad, because I was stressed, But when I was looking up at their menu I only saw chicken and paneer sandwiches, the paneer king melt they called it.
                you see, I wouldn’t eat a paneer king melt just because it was being served at a Burger King, I needed the burger king burger, that was the missing piece. But that was never found, the days I spent in Mumbai were full of stress and I couldn't relax at all until we got to the airport in Sydney where I finally got a regular beef burger.   
    Guys like this come up to you in the airport and start talking, and I think it's because they are nervous about flying, they need to occupy their time before the flight, because they probably got here a little too early. I get the fast food thing, maybe that's what I'm doing now.
    I forced a laugh a little trying to show my appreciation of the comment. It was a sort of funny story after all if I thought about it
    I couldn’t think of much to say back but I didn’t want to leave this strange man hanging,
                Yeah I get that,
                Sometimes you just need a little piece of home, 
            What 
                Sometimes you just need a piece of home 
        Yeah 
        
        What was your name by the way 
        William
        nice to meet you,
        I guess small talk in an airport is a way to feel familiar in an unfamiliar environment as well. 
        What’s your Dunkin order
        I always order the same thing, 
        Bacon egg and cheese on a plain bagel, small hot latte with no sugar, and if I’m feeling like I need it, a coffee cake muffin. 
        No doughnuts?
        No,That’s why they rebranded to just Dunkin, from Dunkin doughnuts it’s because the doughnuts aren’t very good. 
        I don’t know, I’ve always liked them. One of my elementary school teachers used to buy munchkins sometimes, like if we all did well on a test or something. Used to love that.
        Yeah but you liked it because it was out of the ordinary, it was a reward, you probably didn’t like the actual quality of the munchkins.It could’ve been anything you would’ve felt the same, a slice of pizza, a doughnut from somewhere else Maybe. 
        Yeah I guess now that you mention it.
        If you’re eating Dunkin does that mean you’re far from home? 
        Yeah, pretty far, and headed further.  
        Where are you going?
        I travel for work, I have a layover in San Francisco and then I'm off to Hong Kong.
        How longs that flight
        Like 10 hours something like that, I mean i'm pretty used to it.
        I dont know how people get into meetings or stay functional after long flights i feel like i get off like a 2 hour flight and just have to sleep.
        Yeah i'm thankful i don't have to do those, I'm a courier of sorts, a lost distance delivery man. 
        They can't just mail it?
        I guess I'm assigned to things people can't afford to lose, They are willing to spend the extra money for peace of mind. What about you, where are you headed,
        San francisco. 
        At 10?
        Yea
        I guess we are on the same flight.
        You got family there or something?
        Yeah, </pre>

        We talked for a little more but then said some scripted goodbyes, the story stuck with me though and as I was sitting at the gate, eating my bagel, I kept thinking of the conversation, I honestly didn't want to run into him again, every time someone walked up to sit I had just the slightest dread that it might be him. A courier of things that people can't afford to lose, that's gotta be expensive, and I guess it's just strange, the average appearance, the story about the fast food. I feel like this guy is an undercover agent or something. 
        When they started to call for boarding I looked around cautiously, there's no sign of him at all. I made eye contact with a bunch of people by accident, looking at them extra hard to see if my eyes were just tricking me but no, he wasn't there. I gave my boarding pass and walked down the taxiway. I always touch the door frame with my right hand. I'm not ocd or anything but I've just done it since I was little. As I was waiting for everyone to put their bags in the overhead and I could get to my seat, right there in row 5 first class william is sitting, there's a little black box at his feet, with a silver hinged handle. It looks old, like it's made of painted wood or something you would find in your grandparents house. I bet that's the thing someone can't afford to lose. What is in that box?  When we met eyes I gave a slight smile but I may have looked pretty anxious from the outside. I rushed by quickly as the line allowed and finally got back to my seat and tried to rest, it had been a long day already. Despite my eyes being closed I was unable to sleep for the next 6 hours, I just sat there staring at eyelids. 
        </p>

        <p>I just walk around and look at things, take the occasional picture. Sometimes I walk up to big European-looking buildings that probably have something important inside, an art museum or tax office. I wait in the shadow of towering columned entrance and consider walking in. But in the end I always decide not to. I don’t know if it’s that I don’t actually care to go inside or if I’m nervous of that moment when I walk in and there’s a security guard or a government worker and they say 
            Can I help you?
            And all i can say is no, you can’t
            The hills make me pay for this indecision. To circle blocks here is to imagine Sisisphys happy, turning the Conner to another seemilying vertical hill.
            I say this to mean there’s an immense amount of labor and dedication to this task of doing nothing, it’s not simply laziness or low grade depression that keeps me melancholicaly circling. This melancholy is earned and fought for, every step. At the top of there hill one could begin to feel the sublime, if the view wasn’t sleeping under a sheet of fog. The abnormally cold summer provides some relief at the windy peak.
            I sand there the wind takes my hair and pushes it around my head, the longer strands obscure my vision, wrap around my mouth and get between my lips, at the top my head was placed in a cocoon made of hair. At that moment I could be anywhere. Anywhere that had wind that blows, and a sun that occasionally pokes out from behind the clouds, anywhere with cars that honk at intersections and footsteps accompanied by conversations that slowly get louder until a peak where they trail back off into nothing. 
            
            I let it stay like this, for a few minutes, or Mabye just some really long seconds. Before I started to unwrap each strand of hair in little bunches to unveil a face that is no where but here on this paved cold summer hilltop. </p>
