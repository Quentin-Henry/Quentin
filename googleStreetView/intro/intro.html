    <p>I don't remember 9/11. I wasn't alive when it happened. But I do remember the dual shadows the towers casted back onto the city. I grew up in an apartment on 7th street and second ave, and for years after their collapse, their presence was still tangible. The first thing that I ever learned about the towers was that part of them was contained in this textile that sat out on the fire escape. The fabric had been sitting there since the day they fell. I was told I shouldn't touch it because it probably contained toxins. it hadnâ€™t moved from the spot it was frozen in when the towers saturated it.  
        The towers were everywhere. In window picture frames, murals, postcards, in dust filled fabric, nestled in the cracking lead paint on the fire escape and other places just out of reach. It seemed the only place they weren't was that plot of land downtown where they used to be. Each instance of tower had now spread out over miles coating the entire city in a fine dust. All that mass spread out to where each moment of it is so light that it could be washed away in rain or float in the wind. 
    I was surrounded by stories of it. My father worked in building 4, I'm not sure what he did there. But I know he was late that day and the train skipped a stop, as it often did. He stayed down there for a long time, one story says he didn't come home for at least a day, another says he was seen in the afternoon, in the lobby of our apartment building, covered in dust and some kind of glitter-like material that caught the light as he walked by.   
    In 2009 my aunt visited New york, she wanted to throw some of my fathers ashes off the empire state building. It was against the rules, she wasn't a rule-breaker and neither was I. We ran up to the observation deck with this little bag of powder and tossed it off the side as quickly as possible. But just as we threw it, a gust of wind blew it back onto all the tourists standing on the observation deck. My aunt grabbed my hand and we ran out of there, past everyone trying to get the ashes out of their hair and eyes. I like to think these are some of the most well traveled ashes in the world, because instead of catching the wind to 34th street, they got stuck in the hair and mucus membranes of all the italians and floridians occupying the observation deck that day, and over the course of a few days to weeks, probably ended up in the mediterranean basin and gulf coast.  
    When I think of 9/11 I see it. From my own experience of the tower's omnipresence to the countless stories, photographs, videos, old news reels. In my memory it's a collection of hundreds of stories. I never saw the actual towers, my memory of them did not enter through my eyes, and even today it's not stored in my head. It's all on old sd cards and mini dv tapes, film strips. Physical media. which , Like the dust of the towers, spread out from ground zero that day attached to peoples belongings stuck between pages of notebooks and nestled in forgotten spaces. It moved into peoples homes, into dust covered bins in closets full of old winter coats and shoes unworn in years. This media gets found today, when people have to clean or move out. When houses pass to children, and these dust bins and overlooked spaces get seen for the first time in decades. In this way the event still unfolds, when new footage or audio recordings are found. The past is in motion. But the past, unlike the present, doesn't move smoothly, it jumps from one frame to another. 
    In 2013 they found part of a landing gear in between two office buildings on Park Place in the financial district. It's hard to imagine somewhere in the density of lower Manhattan that there is a place no one had been to in over a decade. But I suggest that maybe someone did see it, maybe a business man took his secret smoke break there, it's a good hiding place afterall. tucked away between those two buildings, he looked at it every day. One time in that dark alley, he walked up to it while lighting his cigarette and he said to the landing gear:
    
     Do you think you can keep a secret?

    "Now, my excellent friend," said my companion, "you are in possession of all you need to follow my argument. We see that in the organic world, as thought grows dimmer and weaker, grace emerges more brilliantly and decisively. But just as a section drawn through two lines suddenly reappears on the other side after passing through infinity, or as the image in a concave mirror turns up again right in front of us after dwindling into the distance, so grace itself returns when knowledge has as it were gone through an infinity. Grace appears most purely in that human form which either has no consciousness or an infinite consciousness. That is, in the puppet or in the god."
    "Does that mean", I said in some bewilderment, "that we must eat again of the tree of knowledge in order to return to the state of innocence?"
    "Of course", he said, "but that's the final chapter in the history of the world."

    Two years ago, I accidentally found out I could time travel. I stumbled across this ability that had been in plain sight, only because I failed to seek it out. It was a little button in the corner of the google street view interface. I was working on a project about the history of the east village, specifically the corner I grew up on. At that time two of the buildings on the corner of the intersection had either burned down or exploded and for me it represented something important in the intersection of my personal history and the history of the east village which has always been this strange staging ground for artists and immigrants, their existences against the currents of american history which all seemed to manifest in the strangest places and in the strangest ways all down the east side of the island. The idea of the project was that you could probably connect this one building on the corner of 7th and second with the history of the entire world. 
    Turning the time back was a way I could see the buildings that used to be there. You could of course see them from an old photo as well, but this is different, the old photo has context, it has personality, intentions. Google street view captured this building as cold documentation. Similar to the 1940s tax photos that are used often in papers documenting the history of the city. The point of these things is preservation. To add to this, google street view allows you to walk around, you can see the whole block, how it looks each year, you can move from sight to experience, you navigate through the photos, and build a spatial relationship to the place.
