        <h2>
          My name is Quentin Henry and I'm from New York City. I think I'm
          interested in memetics, or at the very least, things that repeat and
          change a little each time. I explore it through graphic design,
          photography, and writing. I've learned a broad variety of skills while
          working at various jobs in various industries all while I was studying
          various disciplines at various educational facilities in various
          counties. I was lucky enough to travel to various countries and
          encounter various experiences that have greatly shaped the way that I
          live and work. Through these experiences and skills, I've decided that
          I'm interested in graphic design, fast food chains, urban and suburban
          infrastructure, linguistics, ancient history, and maybe a few more
          things. Recently I've found the answers to some of my questions at the
          peaks of mountains, watching clouds that seem to form from nothing at
          all.
